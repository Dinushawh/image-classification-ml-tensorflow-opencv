![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (IPython Notebook) that demonstrates the process of building an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model is designed to classify images into predefined categories or classes.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
